<p id="description">I created this Angular project to familiarize myself with the basic functionalities of Angular. Since I feel confident with React I decided it was time to explore a new technology. I've found Angular quite easy to understand and I'm confident that with a couple of projects under my belt I'll be navigating it like a fish in water. 29/4/2024</p>
